        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hi there, I'm Bandhavi Bendi. After earning a Bachelor's degree in
          Mechanical Engineering in India and working in the field for a year, I
          found my true calling in software engineering. The lure of programming
          led me to learn JAVA, and eventually to build application testing
          frameworks.
        </p>
        <p>
          My tech career began as a Quality Engineer, where I gradually dove
          into script writing and the practical application of JAVA concepts to
          automate tasks, accelerating my career growth. Currently, I serve as a
          Senior Software Development Engineer in Test (Sr. SDET) at Coupa
          Software, San Mateo, CA.
        </p>
        <p align="LEFT">
          Before my present role, I worked for eight years at Oportun as a Staff
          SDET. The desire to further enhance my skills inspired me to dive into
          full-stack development and end-to-end application creation. This
          pursuit led me to a rigorous software development boot camp at UC
          Berkeley Extension. This comprehensive program refined my skills and
          enabled me to build robust full-stack applications. It helped me
          reinforce my knowledge of JavaScript and SQL, learn MongoDB, and
          master modern frameworks like React and Node.js.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an ardent learner, I'm always seeking out fresh opportunities to
          broaden my skills and knowledge. I'm a collaborative team player who
          thrives on working with others to attain a shared objective.
          Currently, I'm on the lookout for a full-time software engineering
          role.
